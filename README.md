This is the second project in our object oriented programming corus in Ariel university second year semeter 1.  
This whole project is made in java 13.0.1.
This project implements monomial and polynomial functions as well as implementing functions and 
complex functions. 
The Functions_gui class implements ways to visualize the functions. 

In the project we learnd to use the StdDraw from Prinsto university, also we learned to use gson (from google) an working with json files.
We also learned and implemented junit test files to some of the files within the project (Polynom, Monom, ComplexFunction and Functions_GUI).
we learned and used git and github to track versions and working in a team environment, also adding a wiki and issues in github.
Since this project is made as an assighnment for a course on object oriented programming, we used interfaces and enum.
